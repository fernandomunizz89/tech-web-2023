# Workshop ULHT - CGI | Cloud Native Development using Azure ‚òÅÔ∏è

**Abstract**üìö: Technical training session focused on developing cloud-based applications using the Microsoft Azure platform. The workshop covers the best practices, technologies, and tools for cloud native development in Azure and helps participants gain a comprehensive understanding of how to build, deploy, and manage cloud-based applications on the Azure platform. 
In this workshop you will be able to build a back-end using **Python** and deployed it has a Azure Functions therefore following a Serverless architecture. For the front-end you will learn to build a **ReactJS** application and deployed to be scalable in Azure. The workshop will also cover topics such as serverless architectures, DevOps practices, and Azure deployment patterns.

# Project üõ†Ô∏è

**Goal**üéØ: Create a Pokemon management application aka Pokedex. In this application the user should be allowed to managed Pokemons, their powers and other characteristics that you think would be good the save, use your imagination.
The main porpuse is to build a web based application using moderns technologies and best practices.

**Datamodel**:

|  Pokemon Entity    | Values and relevant information                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'pokemonName' (pk) | str                                                                                                                                       |
| 'pokedexNumber'    | positive integer                                                                                                                          |
| 'pokemonType'      | (str) - 'normal','fire', 'water', 'grass', 'electric', 'ice', 'fighting', 'poison', 'flying', 'bug', 'psychic', 'ghost', 'dark', 'dragon' |
| 'pokemonColor'     | (str) - 'red', 'green' ,'blue', 'yellow', 'black', 'white', 'purple', 'orange', 'pink'                                                    |
| 'pokemonAttacks'   | [str]                                                                                                                                     |

* **Datamodel Rules**:
    * A Pokemon can have more than one PokemonAttack;
    * The 'pokemonName' is unique, we can't have two pokemons with the same name;
    * The 'pokedexNumber' is unique, we can't have two pokemons with the same number;
    * The 'pokemonColor' and 'pokemonType' are finite values (examples are given in table above).

**Business Rules**
* A web application, accessible from a web browser;
* Data should persist and not disappear when the application is restarted;
* Application accessible from anywhere in the world;
* It should be possible to create, read, update and delete a Pokemon and it's attacks.
